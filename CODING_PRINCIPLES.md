# TripWeather Coding Principles

## 1. Problem Solving & Design
- Consider at least three different solutions to each problem
- Evaluate solutions based on:
  - Clarity
  - Performance
  - Maintainability
  - Scalability
- Choose the best option based on context
- Consult the developer if choices are unclear or tradeoffs exist
- Favor clear structure and explicit logic over cleverness

## 2. Development Workflow
- Write code in small, incremental steps
- After each change, write or update tests to validate logic
- Commit frequently with meaningful messages
- Each commit should represent a complete, working state
- Use feature branches for new features or experiments
- Review code before merging
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Document major changes

## 3. Code Organization and Structure
- Follow a clear, modular architecture
- Keep files focused and single-purpose
- Use meaningful file and directory names
- Maintain a consistent project structure
- Separate configuration from code

## 4. Python Best Practices
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints for better code clarity
- Write docstrings for all functions and classes
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Avoid global variables when possible

## 5. Testing
- Prioritize unit tests for core logic
- Write integration tests for complex interactions
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) structure
- Test edge cases and expected failure modes
- Use mocking for external dependencies
- Maintain good test coverage
- Document test cases

## 6. API Integration
- Implement proper error handling for API calls
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Implement rate limiting and caching where appropriate
- Validate API responses
- Handle timeouts and retries gracefully

## 7. Security
- Never commit sensitive data (API keys, credentials)
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper input validation
- Sanitize user inputs
- Follow security best practices for web applications

## 8. Documentation
- Keep README.md up to date
- Document API endpoints and usage
- Include setup instructions
- Document dependencies and requirements
- Keep code comments clear and relevant

## 9. Error Handling
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors appropriately
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Implement fallback mechanisms where appropriate

## 10. Performance
- Optimize API calls
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Monitor and optimize database queries
- Consider scalability in design
- Profile and optimize critical paths

## 11. Frontend Development
- Follow responsive design principles
- Use semantic HTML
- Implement proper form validation
- Ensure accessibility standards
- Maintain consistent styling

## 12. Environment Setup
- Use virtual environments
- Document setup requirements
- Provide clear installation instructions
- Maintain consistent development environments
- Document environment variables

## 13. Logging
- Implement structured logging
- Use appropriate log levels
- Include relevant context in logs
- Rotate logs appropriately
- Protect sensitive information in logs

## 14. Maintenance
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Regularly review and refactor code
- Monitor and address technical debt
- Document known issues
- Plan for future scalability

## 15. Deployment
- Document deployment procedures
- Implement proper CI/CD pipelines
- Use environment-specific configurations
- Monitor deployments
- Plan for rollback procedures
